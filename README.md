# my_linuxServerIntegrations
Collection of my linux server projects.

---

For now i dont have any tools yet.
This repo is usefull as a showcase and also as my own personal exercise. 

I plan to have folders organized in this repo into something like this:

  * tools[^first]
      - py 
      - others
  * daemons[^second]
  * websites[^third]
      - websiteProject#1
      - websiteProject#2
  * serverApps[^fouth]


[^first]: just messing around ISO/OSI layers or simple scripts.
[^second]: services written by myself.
[^third]: website interfaces.
[^fouth]: just beign a lil ambitious are we?
