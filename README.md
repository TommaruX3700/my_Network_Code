# my_linuxServerIntegrations
collection of my linux server projects

For now i dont have any tools yet.
This repo is usefull as a showcase and also as my own personal exercise. 

I plan to have folders organized in this repo into something like this:
  > tools_______________________________________//just messing around ISO/OSI layers or simple scripts 
      - py 
      - others
  > daemons_____________________________________//services written by myself
  > websites____________________________________//website interfaces
      - websiteProject#1
      - websiteProject#2
  > serverApps__________________________________//just beign a lil ambitious here isnt it?
