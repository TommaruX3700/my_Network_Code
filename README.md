# my_linuxServerIntegrations
collection of my linux server projects

For now i dont have any tools yet.
This repo is usefull as a showcase and also as my own personal exercise. 

I plan to have folders organized in this repo into something like this:

  > tools_____________________//just messing around ISO/OSI layers or simple scripts 
      - py 
      - others

  > daemons___________________/services written by myself

  > websites__________________//website interfaces
      - websiteProject#1
      - websiteProject#2

  > serverApps________________/just beign a lil ambitious here isnt it?
